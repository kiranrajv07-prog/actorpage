Anime is a style of Japanese animation that often features distinctive, colorful graphics, vibrant characters, and action-filled plots. The term itself comes from the Japanese word for "animation," but outside of Japan, it specifically refers to animation that originates from Japan. Anime covers a wide variety of genres and themes, from science fiction and fantasy to romance and slice-of-life stories, and can be found in many forms like 
television, films, and online.
